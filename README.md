## About Us

gitChat was built as a final group project by three devMountain students.

### `Technologies Used`

This app was built with React.js and Firebase.<br>
React was used to make an efficient and responsive frontend, while Firebase was implemented as the backend and realtime database. Authorization, image uploading, storage, and hosting are also handled via Firebase.
